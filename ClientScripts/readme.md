Client Scripts run on the client-side (web browser) when interacting with a record in NetSuite.

They can be used to enhance the user interface, add validations, perform calculations, or trigger custom actions based on user interactions.

Client Scripts can be written in SuiteScript 1.0 or SuiteScript 2.0.
